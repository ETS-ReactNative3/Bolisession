# BoliSession App Project Directory

## Quick Overview About BoliSession App Usage and Functionality
Goal: Create a social media app for the Southeast Asian dance community (i.e. Bhangra community) which allows users and existing dance teams to connect with each other and have a public platform to discuss all the recent developments in the dance community. This app will allow teams (university, professional-gig, etc.) to fill empty roles quickly by viewing profiles of local users in which users have the ability to showcase their talent in the form of a profile background video.

### App Features: 
- User and Team account type. (Each with their own set of features).
- Live social media feed similar to twitter 
- Direct messaging capability 
- Profile creation similar to twitter but with added 'background profile video' feature
- Maps feature to broadcast your location to other users in the community

### Upcoming features:
- Creation of a Competition account type to allow Teams to directly apply to competitions


### Tech Stack:
Originally BoliSession was going to be a web application built on the MERN stack. That is no longer the case.
BoliSession is a mobile application built using: 
- React Native 
- Firebase (for Authentication, Database, Storage, and fetching Data)
- Redux (Redux has been setup but it will be implemented as the app grows larger)
